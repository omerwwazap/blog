### A new Coordinate System ‚Äî OSINT Challenge 23

After a very long break from my blogs I‚Äôm back with a standard Quiztime\. Shared by contributor [@kollege](http://twitter.com/kollege) \. The objective was simple\. We had to figure out where the photo was taken\. Please refer to the embedded link below for the original post:

Don‚Äôt read any further if you‚Äôd like to test your geolocation skills\. Open the picture and give it a try\. I will be discussing how I found it and since I just started this hobby\. I‚Äôll probably be doing this the long way around :\)


> _Lastly, English is not my native language\. So, I apologize for any mistakes that I might make\._ 





Before we start, check out ‚Äúwhat3words‚Äù it‚Äôs an cool and easy way to give coordinates\. In their words, ‚Äú **What3words is the simplest way to talk about location\.** ‚Äù It has divided the world into 3m x 3m squares, each with a unique three\-word address\.
### Warning spoilers ahead

After looking at the image, I believe this is near an Asian embassy or from Asia\.


![Because of this building\.](assets/6f7d87819358/1*HfVoa1XdRj1wTJo3uGPBeg.png)

Because of this building\.

But let‚Äôs do some RIS \(Reverse Image Search\) on Google\.


![Hmm\.](assets/6f7d87819358/1*3vTBVYderRllkglMxvsHuw.png)

Hmm\.

These three images look really close to what we are searching for\.


![WOW](assets/6f7d87819358/1*p5lAeRmf8y5xDrH332lOqg.png)

WOW

And we have an perfect match\. YEY\.

And after searching for the location on Google Maps for about 5 minutes, I found this place\. If you did search this by yourself, you should have noticed some weird stuff about China‚Äôs roads on Google Maps\. The satellite view and the map markings don‚Äôt match up\. If you wonder why, check out this short video, [Why Every Map of China is Just Slightly Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Di-UVC-_4) \.
