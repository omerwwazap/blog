## Introducing Savunma Atlas: Your Interactive Guide to Turkey's Defense Industry

The Turkish defense sector is in a period of historic transformation. From 5th-generation fighter jets taking their first flight to new frigates joining the fleet, the pace of development is staggering. For industry professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts, tracking these advancements can feel like trying to assemble a complex puzzle with pieces scattered all over the internet.

Until now.

Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of **Savunma Atlas**, a new, data-driven web platform designed to be the definitive, interactive inventory of Turkey's defense projects.

## The Problem: Information Overload

Keeping up with projects like KAAN, Kızılelma, or the TF-2000 Destroyer means sifting through countless news articles, official announcements, and company websites. Key data points—like project start dates, first flights, production status, and inventory numbers—are often fragmented and difficult to compare.

We wanted to change that. We envisioned a single, clean, and powerful platform where all this information was centralized and beautifully presented. That vision is now **Savunma Atlas**.

## The Solution: Data at Your Fingertips

Savunma Atlas transforms raw data into an intuitive, visual experience. When you land on our homepage, you are greeted with a comprehensive dashboard of project cards. Each card gives you an at-a-glance summary of a key defense program, including its name, an image, the lead company, and its current status.

But this is just the beginning. The real power of Savunma Atlas lies in its interactive features.

### 1. Powerful Filtering: Focus on What Matters

Are you interested only in naval advancements or the latest in air power? With our one-click filters, you can instantly refine the entire database.

- **Click "Air"** to see everything from the KAAN fighter jet and the Bayraktar TB2 drone to the Gökbey helicopter.
- **Click "Sea"** to isolate naval projects like the TCG Anadolu (LHD), İstif-class Frigates, and the ambitious MILDEN national submarine.

This allows you to cut through the noise and focus your research on a specific domain of the defense industry.

### 2. Insightful Sorting: Uncover Trends and Timelines

Data becomes knowledge when you can organize it effectively. Savunma Atlas gives you the power to sort the entire inventory by different criteria:

- **Sort by Name:** Quickly find a specific project alphabetically.
- **Sort by Start Date:** Discover the historical timeline of projects. See which programs have been in development the longest, or sort in reverse to instantly see the newest initiatives like the MUGEM Aircraft Carrier.
- **Sort by Service Date:** See which platforms are the most recent additions to the Turkish Armed Forces' inventory.

This simple tool allows you to analyze the data from different perspectives, revealing trends and providing deeper context.

### 6. A Living Database

Savunma Atlas is not a static report; it's a living project. As new milestones are reached, new programs are announced, and statuses change, we will be continuously updating the database. Our goal is to ensure that Savunma Atlas remains the most accurate and up-to-date public resource for tracking Turkey's defense industry.
