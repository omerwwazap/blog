# Raspberry Pi Basics of GPIO - My Hobby Projects[^1]

This is a simple blog post to talk about my [Github repo](https://github.com/omerwwazap/Raspberry-Pi-GPIO-Usage) where I find random hobbyist projects and try to make them my self.

My first ever project was to make an [Basic Led Blink and Led Button Programs](https://github.com/omerwwazap/Raspberry-Pi-GPIO-Usage#basic-led-blink-and-led-button-programs)

[Led Switch](https://github.com/omerwwazap/Raspberry-Pi-Basic-GPIO/blob/master/Led-Program/Switch) |  [Led Button](https://github.com/omerwwazap/Raspberry-Pi-Basic-GPIO/blob/master/Led-Program/Button) |
