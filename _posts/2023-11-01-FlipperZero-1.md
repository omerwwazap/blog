# Hello! "Esheze" - Flipper Zero

Before we start with some random projects ideas have a look at my pet Esheze.

So, what is a Flipper Zero? In 10-year-old terms üòÖ  

It's a special electronic tool, kind of like a Swiss Army knife, but for computers. It's used by people who want to learn about computers, security, and technology. It's like a secret agent gadget that helps you test and understand how things like keys, locks, and computer systems work.

One thing to note, you should get permission if you are testing stuff that aren't yours. üëç

## Projects Ideas - BadUSB

### Fun Ideas

- Open RickRoll or Blue Screen of Death Image
- Open Fake Windows/OSX Update Screen

### Fast Diagnose Tools

- It resets Network configs
- Runs sfc and DISM
- Runs update for defender
- Activates Office/Windows (lol)
- Copy/print/list stored passwords - browsers/windows?
  - Should be possible with *[Nirsoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/)* programs

Anyway after I start working on these projects I'll be updating this post and will write new post explaining on how I did it. 

In the mean time here is the [Flipper Zero Documentation](https://docs.flipper.net/)
