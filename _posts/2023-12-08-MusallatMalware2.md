## Information on Practical Malware Analysis

This malware is an **.exe executable**, indicating that it was compiled. But what does that mean? In general, software is developed using high-level, human-readable programming languages like C, C++, Java, Rust, Swift, and others. To make it understandable for a machine, the program must be compiled into machine code. During the compilation process, the human-readable code gets translated into a language that the CPU can execute. But for there is a problem because once a program is compiled, the original human-readable source code is typically, but not always, no longer available.

This is why we require [Decompiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler) and/or [Disassembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler) tools that can convert machine code back into human-readable code. However, this process is not always reliable

*In any case, let's start checking out **MusaLLaT.exe.***
