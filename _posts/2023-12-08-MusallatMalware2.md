## Information on Practical Malware Analysis

This malware is an **.exe executable**. Meaning it was compiled. What is that? Well, generally speaking, software is developed using a high-level human readable programming language such as C, C++, Java, Rust, Swift etc. In order for a machine to understand it, the program needs to be compiled to machine code. The compilation process translates the human readable code to a language that can be executed by the CPU. Problem is once a program is compiled, the human readable source code is almost always no longer available.

That's why we need a [Decompiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompiler) and/or [Disassembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler)tools that which can convert machine code to a human readable code. However this is is not always reliable.
